Thoughts:  This notebook is complete in terms of preprocesing the data.  The process for this particular set of data was quite different to many of the other datasets that I have worked with.    As such, I was a little hesitant about the way I approached test, train, split.  After checking out others' notebooks, its clear that most people are getting ~.99 AUC on the training data and in the end this competition comes down to that last .0001 in terms of accuracy.  I will return to work with this data at a later point in time.
